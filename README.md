**1. Key Features to Consider:**
Your deployment framework should support the following features:

**Environment Management:**

Separate configurations for DEV, TEST, and PROD.
Parameterized database, schema, and role management.
Automated DDL Execution:

Deploy tables, views, stored procedures, and other objects via SQL scripts.
Version control integration (e.g., Git).
Dependency Handling:

Ensure objects are created in the correct order.
Implement checks for existing dependencies.
Secrets Management:

Secure handling of credentials using environment variables or a secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Snowflake Secrets).
Logging and Error Handling:

Detailed logging of each deployment step.
Rollback in case of failures.
Parallel Execution:

Concurrent deployment of independent objects to speed up the process.
